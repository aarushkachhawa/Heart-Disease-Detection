**How can we most accurately predict Cardiovascular Disease using Machine Learning Methodologies?**

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for **868,662** deaths in the US in 2017. CVD claims more lives each year than all forms of cancer and Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (CLRD) combined. Correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats in individuals. CVD is also associated with modifiable risk factors pertaining to lifestyle and intervention. Hence timing of detection and diagnostic accuracy is especially crucial for patients with CVD.

Machine Learning techniques are increasingly becoming more pivotal in the interpretation and early diagnosis of heart disease in patients. This project explores various machine learning algorithms for detection and prediction accuracy.  

My hypothesis is that Cardiovascular Disease can be best predicted through the use of supervised machine learning models like an **Artificial Neural Network** because of the complex correlations between multiple features and the disease that can’t be modeled by a simple regression.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aarushkachhawa/Heart-Disease-Detection/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
